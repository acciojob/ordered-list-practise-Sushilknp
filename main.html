        <li>Machine Independent Optimization: This code optimization phase attempts to improve the intermediate code to
            get a better target code as the output. The part of the intermediate code which is transformed here does not
            involve any CPU registers or absolute memory locations.</li>
        <li>Machine Dependent Optimization: Machine-dependent optimization is done after the target code has been
            generated and when the code is transformed according to the target machine architecture. It involves CPU
            registers and may have absolute memory references rather than relative references. Machine-dependent
            optimizers put efforts to take maximum advantage of the memory hierarchy.

        <li>An induction variable is used in the loop for the following kind of assignment i = i + constant. It is a
            kind of Loop Optimization Technique.
